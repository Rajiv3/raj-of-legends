 def storeSummonerInfo(self):
Use this to store the data in a file. Then save the information for later.
Enter in a summoner and it will pull the data from last time, with the option to update it.


NEED to check if required things exist before calling them - avoiding this will result in disaster


API request limited to 100 per 2 minutes - harder to pull lots of data without waiting
