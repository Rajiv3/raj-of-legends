Enter in a summoner and it will pull the data from last time, with the option to update it.
user can request to pull data from further back if wanted

match stats will go into a players folder and pull the info from what is saved there

Want different match history files: Master(done), all games on specified champion, all games in specified queue, all games that are a mix of those

2 ways of doing this: pull from the master match history or pull the data from the api 
-pulling from api is better

-so need to keep a master match history for each of the champions and queues.
-still want to put these games into master
-need multiple game ID files?
-for the values in the game ID files, download the match data

- dont want multiple matches folders - need to deal with these in a different way (just use the game id files to look for the relevant games)
